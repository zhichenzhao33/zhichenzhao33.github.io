  <summary>Abstract  In this work, we explore the forecasting ability of a recently proposed normalizing and variance-stabilizing (NoVaS) transforma-tion with the possible inclusion of exogenous variables in GARCH volatility specification. The NoVaS prediction method, whichis inspired by a model-free prediction principle, has generally shown more accurate, stable and robust (to misspecifications)performan...</summary>
