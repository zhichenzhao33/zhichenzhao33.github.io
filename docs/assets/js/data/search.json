The NoVaS prediction method, whichis inspired by a model-free prediction principle, has generally shown more accurate, stable and robust (to misspecifications)performance than that compared with classical GARCH-type methods. We derive the NoVaS transformation needed to includeexogenous covariates and then construct the corresponding prediction procedure for multiple exogenous covariates. We addressboth point and interval forecasts using NoVaS type methods. We show through extensive simulation studies that bolster ourclaim that the NoVaS method outperforms traditional ones, especially for long-term time aggregated predictions. We also exhibithow our method could utilize geopolitical risks in forecasting volatility in national stock market indices. From an applied point-of-view for practitioners and policymakers, our methodology provides a distribution-free approach to forecast volatility and shedslight on how to leverage extra knowledge such as fundamentals- and sentiments-based information to improve the predictionaccuracy of market volatility."

Abstract  Deep neural networks (DNN) has received increasing attention in machine learning applications in the last several years. Recently, a non-asymptotic error bound has been developed to measure the performance of the fully connected DNN estimator with ReLU activation functions for estimating regression models. The paper at hand gives a small improvement on the current error bound based on the latest results on the approximation ability of (forward) DNN. More importantly, however, a non-random subsampling technique–scalable subsampling–is applied to construct a `subagged’  DNN estimator. Under regularity conditions, it is shown that the subagged DNN estimator is computationally efficient without sacrificing accuracy for either estimation or prediction tasks. Beyond point estimation/prediction, we propose different approaches to build confidence and prediction intervals based on the subagged DNN estimator. In addition to being asymptotically valid, the proposed confidence/prediction intervals appear to work well in  finite samples. All in all, the scalable subsampling DNN estimator offers the  complete package in terms of statistical inference, i.e.,    (a) computational efficiency;   (b) point estimation/prediction accuracy; and   (c) allowing for the construction of practically useful confidence and prediction intervals."

    "content": "Abstract  Because climate change broadcasts a large aggregate risk to the overall macroeconomy and the global financial system, we investigate how a temperature anomaly and/or its volatility affect the accuracy of forecasts of stock return volatility. To this end, we do not apply only the classical GARCH and GARCHX models, but rather we apply newly proposed model-free prediction methods, and use GARCH-NoVaS and GARCHX-NoVaS models to compute volatility predictions. These two models are based on a normalizing and variance-stabilizing transformation (NoVaS transformation) and are guided by a so-called model-free prediction principle. Applying the new models to data for South Africa, we find that climate-related information is helpful in forecasting stock return volatility. Moreover, the novel model-free prediction method can incorporate such exogenous information better than the classical GARCH approach, as revealed by the the squared prediction errors. More importantly, the forecast comparison test reveals that the advantage of applying exogenous information related to climate risks in prediction of the South African stock return volatility is significant over a century of monthly data (February 1910–February 2023). Our findings have important implications for academics, investors, and policymakers."

    "content": "Abstract  The nonlinear autoregressive (NLAR) model plays an important role in modeling and predicting time series. One-step ahead prediction is straightforward using the NLAR model, but the multi-step ahead prediction is cumbersome. For instance, iterating the one-step ahead predictor is a convenient strategy for linear autoregressive (LAR) models, but it is suboptimal under NLAR. In this article, we first propose a simulation and/or bootstrap algorithm to construct optimal point predictors under an $L_1$ or $L_2$ loss criterion. In addition, we construct bootstrap prediction intervals in the multi-step ahead prediction problem; in particular, we develop an asymptotically valid quantile prediction interval as well as a pertinent prediction interval for future values. To correct the undercoverage of prediction intervals with finite samples, we further employ predictive—as opposed to fitted—residuals in the bootstrap process. Simulation and empirical studies are also given to substantiate the finite sample performance of our methods."

Abstract  To address the difficult problem of the multi-step-ahead prediction of nonparametric autoregressions, we consider a forward bootstrap approach. Employing a local constant estimator, we can analyze a general type of nonparametric time-series model and show that the proposed point predictions are consistent with the true optimal predictor. We construct a quantile prediction interval that is asymptotically valid. Moreover, using a debiasing technique, we can asymptotically approximate the distribution of multi-step-ahead nonparametric estimation by the bootstrap. As a result, we can build bootstrap prediction intervals that are pertinent, i.e., can capture the model estimation variability, thus improving the standard quantile prediction intervals. Simulation studies are presented to illustrate the performance of our point predictions and pertinent prediction intervals for finite samples."

    "content": "Abstract  Volatility forecasting is important in financial econometrics and is mainly based on the application of various GARCH-type models. However, it is difficult to choose a specific GARCH model that works uniformly well across datasets, and the traditional methods are unstable when dealing with highly volatile or short-sized datasets. The newly proposed normalizing and variance stabilizing (NoVaS) method is a more robust and accurate prediction technique that can help with such datasets. This model-free method was originally developed by taking advantage of an inverse transformation based on the frame of the ARCH model. In this study, we conduct extensive empirical and simulation analyses to investigate whether it provides higher-quality long-term volatility forecasting than standard GARCH models. Specifically, we found this advantage to be more prominent with short and volatile data. Next, we propose a variant of the NoVaS method that possesses a more complete form and generally outperforms the current state-of-the-art NoVaS method. The uniformly superior performance of NoVaS-type methods encourages their wide application in volatility forecasting. Our analyses also highlight the flexibility of the NoVaS idea that allows the exploration of other model structures to improve existing models or solve specific prediction problems."

To acquire meaningful volatility predictions, various methods were built upon GARCH-type models, but these classical techniques suffer from instability of short and volatile data. Recently, a novel existing normalizing and variance-stabilizing (NoVaS) method for predicting squared log-returns of financial data was proposed. This model-free method has been shown to possess more accurate and stable prediction performance than GARCH-type methods. However, whether this method can sustain this high performance for long-term prediction is still in doubt. In this article, we firstly explore the robustness of the existing NoVaS method for long-term time-aggregated predictions. Then, we develop a more parsimonious variant of the existing method. With systematic justification and extensive data analysis, our new method shows better performance than current NoVaS and standard GARCH(1,1) methods on both short- and long-term time-aggregated predictions. The success of our new method is remarkable since efficient predictions with short and volatile data always carry great importance. Additionally, this article opens potential avenues where one can design a model-free prediction structure to meet specific needs."
